The source code for the toolbox can be found in KTH internal github. application bibutils_6.2_for_DiVA is a tool that can batch convert mods generate from Connecting Silo(folder polls) into bibtex. The application bibutils_6.2_for_DiVA is build base on Professor  Gerald Q. Maguire Jr. from Royal Institute of Technology Sweden [1] <br />
 Polls:<br />
 Name of the module will be changed later.....<br />

 Output Data: output<br />

 bibutils_6.2_for_DiVA:<br />
 Main class:xml2bib_loop.py<br />
 Rest of the class and method information can be found under professor  Gerald Q. Maguire Jr repositiory: https://github.com/gqmaguirejr/bibutils_6.2_for_DiVA [1] <br />

 Install project requisition:<br />
 run './install_requisition.sh'<br />
 project is using python pip3,pip,conda,selenium, lxml and geckodriver for firefox<br />
 Project is build upon Django framwork<br />
 User need to configure config.json under 'polls/src/Canvas/canvas' and KTHconfig.json under 'polls/src/KTH' for the program to excecute  properly<br />
 Under config.json user need to input oauth token and the address of the Canvas server.<br />
 
 General start up:<br />
 bibutils_6.2_for_DiVA:<br />
 python xml2bib_loop.py 'path of the output folder'<br />
 For this project the 'path of the output folder' is '../polls/output/parse_result'
 Polls:<br />
 The data in the thesis report is partially automated with module: test_accuracy.py <br />

 DiVA location for thesis report:<br />

 



 Note:<br />
