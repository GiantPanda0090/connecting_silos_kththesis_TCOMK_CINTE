<heading>3.1 Piezoelectric Ceramics</heading> 

<heading>3 )</heading> 

<heading>For example, sodium potassium niobate displays</heading> 

<heading>properties very identical to PZT without the lead existence.</heading> 

<heading>PZT is important because of its high Curie temperature that allows it to operate in a</heading> 

<heading>wide range before it loses the piezoelectricity effect. In the past few years a wide</heading> 

<heading>range of this material has been modified by changing their chemical composition such</heading> 

<heading>as PZT-5H and PZT5-A.</heading> 

<heading>Piezoelectric ceramics are chosen based on the characteristics of the mechanical</heading> 

<heading>energy applied to them. One of the advantages for piezo ceramics is their easy</heading> 

<heading>integration to thin sheets can simply be planted on a cantilever beam structure, which</heading> 

<heading>this mechanical structure is one of the most used structure in energy harvesters.</heading> 

<heading>Roundy[5] did a study using a PZT-5A ceramic on a cantilever beam with a length of</heading> 

<heading>1,75 cm while a proof mass was attached to the tip of the cantilever to decrease its</heading> 

<heading>resonance frequency. The device was set at 100 Hz and, matching its natural</heading> 

<heading>frequency and a driving acceleration of 2.25 m/s 2 . By setting the load resistance to</heading> 

<heading>about 220 ohms , he achieved a power around 60 í µí¼í µí±. Later he experienced with two</heading> 

<heading>additional lengths of 1.5 cm and 3 cm and was able to achieve an output power of 200</heading> 

<heading>í µí¼í µí± and 380 í µí¼í µí±, respectively. Yuan et al [6] also studied the output power of</heading> 

<heading>trapezoidal and rectangular PZT cantilevers, which were a few centimeters larger than</heading> 

<heading>Also complete insensitiveness to humidity</heading> 

<heading>and to atmosphere change, this material is considered a favorable material.</heading> 

<heading>3.2 Piezoelectric polymers</heading> 

<heading>PVDF (polyvinylidene difluoride ) as a semi-</heading> 

<heading>crystalline polymer is one of the extreme cases of the high-energy density material</heading> 

<heading>among piezoelectric polymers. It contains about 50% crystals that are embedded in an</heading> 

<heading>amorphous matrix. Beside their high-energy density, they are easy to deform under</heading> 

<heading>the mechanical shock, which makes them resilient and suitable for curved surfaces.</heading>

<heading>respectively, mounted on it was exposed to force equal to 1 N. The force was applied</heading> 

<heading>on different placed of the beam. The following results shows how output energy can</heading>
