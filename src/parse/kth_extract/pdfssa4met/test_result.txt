<p>Piezoelectric energy harvesting has been around for almost a decade to generate</p>
<p>power from the ambient vibrations. Although the generated power is very small, but</p>
<p>there are several ways to increase and enhance the generated power. This project</p>
<p>presents different methods of optimizing the output power by changing the structural</p>
<p>configuration of the energy harvesters, selection of piezoelectric material and circuit</p>
<p>interface of these harvesters. To understand the different steps of the enhancement,</p>
<p>the process of energy conversion by piezoelectric material has been first looked at.</p>
<p>Different groups of piezoelectric material were studied to see what kind of materials</p>
<p>have the ability of increasing the generated power. As mechanical configuration of the</p>
<p>energy harvesters has a significant effect on the output voltage, their configuration</p>
<p>such as Cantilever beam type, Cymbal type and Circular diaphragms has been</p>
<p>described and compared. After the power generated in the piezoelectric crystal , the</p>
<p>current is sent to through an interface circuit to get rectified and regulated. This circuit</p>
<p>can be modified to increase the power as well. There are several types of circuits that</p>
<p>can increase the output voltage significantly. Synchronized Switch Harvesting (SSH)</p>
<p>techniques, Synchronous Electric Charge Extraction technique and voltage doubler</p>
<p>are such examples. These techniques have been also studied and compared.</p>
<p>Because of the outgrowing industry of piezoelectric energy harvesting in Medical</p>
<p>field, their function and their progress has also been reviewed.</p>

<p>Increasing the output voltage of piezoelectric energy harvesters are one of the most</p>
<p>important aspects in this field. This is because of their low range of generated power</p>
<p>which has to be increased if it is desired to be used in the industry. For this reason,</p>
<p>this work has been based to find different solutions that lead the piezoelectric energy</p>
<p>harvesters to experience a boost of power. During the research, it was noticed that</p>
<p>there are three important facts that can lead to such a boost and based on those, the</p>
<p>work of this study was directed to a certain direction for finding advantages and</p>
<p>disadvantages of different methods for power enhancement in piezoelectric energy</p>
<p>harvesting. These facts include harvester’s mechanical configuration which is about</p>
<p>how piezoelectric crystals can be used in a mechanical system so the stress can be</p>
<p>applied easier for a maximum power. In this matter, three different configurations</p>
<p>were studied and compared to see which model is most likely to generate a desirable</p>
<p>amount of power. The second method affecting the output voltages is the right choice</p>
<p>of material. In this part, piezoelectric material was divided in to three different groups</p>
<p>and each was studied and compared to each other. Furthermore, to investigate how the</p>
<p>output power can be enhanced, electrical circuits that transfer the generated power</p>
<p>from the piezoelectric material to a storage buffer was studied. Different circuit</p>
<p>topologies used nowadays in this field, were chosen and compared to see which</p>
<p>circuit topology can enhance the power.</p>
<p>An experimental work was also conducted to see how vibration and deflection can</p>
<p>affect the generated and a simple circuit with a piezoelectric power source was</p>
<p>connected to a LED to experiment if the piezo material can light up the LED.</p>
<p>Last but not at least, the application of piezoelectric energy harvesting in the medical</p>
<p>field was reviewed to see whether if this kind of technology has a bright future in the</p>
<p>medicine.</p>

<heading>3 )</heading>
<heading>For example, sodium potassium niobate displays</heading>
<heading>properties very identical to PZT without the lead existence.</heading>
<heading>PZT is important because of its high Curie temperature that allows it to operate in a</heading>
<heading>wide range before it loses the piezoelectricity effect. In the past few years a wide</heading>
<heading>range of this material has been modified by changing their chemical composition such</heading>
<heading>as PZT-5H and PZT5-A.</heading>
<heading>Piezoelectric ceramics are chosen based on the characteristics of the mechanical</heading>
<heading>energy applied to them. One of the advantages for piezo ceramics is their easy</heading>
<heading>integration to thin sheets can simply be planted on a cantilever beam structure, which</heading>
<heading>this mechanical structure is one of the most used structure in energy harvesters.</heading>
<heading>Roundy[5] did a study using a PZT-5A ceramic on a cantilever beam with a length of</heading>
<heading>1,75 cm while a proof mass was attached to the tip of the cantilever to decrease its</heading>
<heading>resonance frequency. The device was set at 100 Hz and, matching its natural</heading>
<heading>frequency and a driving acceleration of 2.25 m/s 2 . By setting the load resistance to</heading>
<heading>about 220 ohms , he achieved a power around 60 í µí¼í µí±. Later he experienced with two</heading>
<heading>additional lengths of 1.5 cm and 3 cm and was able to achieve an output power of 200</heading>
<heading>í µí¼í µí± and 380 í µí¼í µí±, respectively. Yuan et al [6] also studied the output power of</heading>
<heading>trapezoidal and rectangular PZT cantilevers, which were a few centimeters larger than</heading>
<heading>Also complete insensitiveness to humidity</heading>
<heading>and to atmosphere change, this material is considered a favorable material.</heading>
<heading>3.2 Piezoelectric polymers</heading>
<heading>PVDF (polyvinylidene difluoride ) as a semi-</heading>
<heading>crystalline polymer is one of the extreme cases of the high-energy density material</heading>
<heading>among piezoelectric polymers. It contains about 50% crystals that are embedded in an</heading>
<heading>amorphous matrix. Beside their high-energy density, they are easy to deform under</heading>
<heading>the mechanical shock, which makes them resilient and suitable for curved surfaces.</heading>
