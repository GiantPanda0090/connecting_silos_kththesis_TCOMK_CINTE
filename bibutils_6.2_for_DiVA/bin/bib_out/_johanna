title="Vild natur: V{\"a}rden, attityder och associationer",
abstract="Modern humans are considered to have lost connection to nature and actions to reduce the separation between man and nature has been demanded. Green areas are often valued from a broad perspective and few studies have investigated the specific nature of the wild habitat. There also seem to be definitive problems and conflicts regarding the concept of ``wild nature''. The purpose of this report is to identify the specific values of wild nature and to investigate what the concept really can include. Another purpose is to investigate attitudes and associations to wild nature and how wild nature is being worked on in planning. A literature study has been used as the primary method. The literature study has been supplemented with a minor case study including a documentary study, interviews and questionnaires. The conclusion is that wild nature offers values of ecological, educational and experiential character. The ecological value is that wild nature allows biodiversity. The educational value includes aspects that help strengthen the connection to nature, which may lead to changed environmental behavior. Wild nature also has values that concerns for example the experience of spiritual and reflective emotions, contributing to stress reduction and increased well-being. Moreover, wild nature is associated with large areas unaffected by humans. The same approaches are in the planning process, and the experience of wild nature is often evaluated from an ecological perspective. This means that the potential of green spaces that does not fit into the traditional image is not taken advantage of. Wild nature can also be defined based on the experience qualities related to wildness. A development towards such an approach could mean that the specific nature of the wild nature is taken advantage of. This could contribute to the increased well-being of the residents, but in the long term, a more sustainable society."
