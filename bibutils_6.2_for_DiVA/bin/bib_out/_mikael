title="A Future in Sustainable Development: Backcasting the SDGs",
abstract="In	2015	the	17	Sustainable	Development	Goals	were	adopted	by	193	member	 states	of	the	United	Nations.	The	SDGs	are	highly	ambitious	and	their	underlying	 processes	are	interconnected	by	causal	relationships.	Work	towards	fulfilling	 them	therefore	requires	considering	how	solutions	for	one	goal	will	impacts	 others.	In	this	study	target-oriented	backcasting	is	applied	to	examine	set	goals	 in	the	future,	as	well	as	to	determine	the	current	state	and	trends	of	 development.	This	is	done	in	an	effort	to	determine	conflicts	between	targets	and	 resource	limitations	of	future	development.	The	findings	suggest	that	the	current	 paradigm	of	giving	GDP	growth	highest	societal	priority,	leads	to	a	causal	 relationship	where	development	occurs	at	the	expense	of	sustainability	at	the	 global	level.	In	order	to	overcome	this,	the	fulfilment	of	the	SDGs	has	to	be	given	 higher	priority	than	the	size	and	growth	rate	of	the	GDP."
