title="Is the Revised Payment Service Directive a Threat? A Study on Strategic Opportunities as a Necessity for a Traditional Swedish Bank in the Payment Industry",
abstract="During recent years, the payment industry has faced increasing competition. Technological development is paving the way for new market entrants that have managed to claim market space. To regulate the new entrants the European Commission proposed the second payment service directive where banks are obligated to provide them, with the permission from the customer, access to their customers accounts. The purpose of the study was to provide insights on what key capabilities are necessary for a traditional retail bank in the future payment landscape. To investigate and understand the payment sector the study adopts a system perspective. The research has mainly been qualitative, thus, the findings are based on interviews with market experts and bank representatives. The study shows that the most intense competition is at the point of sale interaction and that the revised payment service directive is not a threat. From the investigation it is concluded that card transactions will remain, for the foreseeable future, the dominant payment instrument, but also what is being regulated should be utilized. The necessary capabilities for a traditional retail bank is therefore to continue innovate around cards and continue to issue them. To take advantage of the new payment directive it will be necessary to aggregate and compile customer information from multiple banks and facilitate transactions between customer accounts held in different banks. Finally, any strategic approach should not revolve around the regulation posed by the European Commission. Instead, it is necessary to consider the global trend that is changing the payment landscape.
