title="Electrifying Linear Motion: The role of cumulative advantages when market closures are challenged",
abstract="There are product designs that win the allegiance of the market, whose designs competitors and innovators must adhere to if they hope to retain or achieve a significant market follow- ing. These designs can be described as the market closure; design solutions that should be taken as the point of departure for future development. In this study, we investigate the closure sur- rounding pneumatic- and hydraulic systems for creating linear motion, such as cylinders and its surrounding components. The market of linear motion is currently undergoing a shift towards electrification; enabling several advantages over- and potentially replacing traditional technolo- gies. However, many electrified versions of traditional technologies are still not mature enough to completely replace the current market closure. As the closure is being challenged, how customers respond can be uncertain and how customer revenue is affected is unknown. Even though a supplier might retain its competitive advantage, such as lower costs or higher quality, it is not certain if their cumulative advantage will be re- tained. This means that it is uncertain if the accumulation of positive customer interactions through purchases with competitive advantages will remain impactful on supplier selection pro- cesses when the technology on which the interactions are based on is replaced. In order to get insight into the experiences of customers, a qualitative study is conducted to provide us with detailed information on the subject. The interviews in this study are primarily aimed at understanding the customers' perception of electrification and cumulative advantage. The results indicate that suppliers' cumulative advantage can be affected negatively if electrifica- tion challenges the market closures. Moreover, we found that it seems most likely that the impact of cumulative advantage on supplier selection will be decreased. Thereby, this paper contributes to the area of cumulative advantage as previous studies have not considered how cumulative advantage is affected by market changes."
