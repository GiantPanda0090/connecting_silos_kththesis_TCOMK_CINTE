title="On the impact of wind power on CO2 emissions in a power system: Backcasting the SDGs",
abstract="This master thesis is carried out at KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm the spring 2017. The project analyses the impact of wind power in a power system. A ﬁctitious power system, created from the Nordic32 test system, is used for the analysis. The power sources in the test system are hydro power, nuclear power, CHP and wind power, resembling Swedish conditions. The power production planning in the system is solved as a mixed integer linear programming problem in GAMS with hourly resolution. From the result of the planning problem calculations of CO emissions are carried out with Monte Carlo simulations. Diﬀerent cases with diﬀer- ent amounts of wind power installed in the test system are studied via a stochastic Markov model. The load model in the test system consists of hourly time series data for a speciﬁc day. Furthermore, challenges with wind power as a continuously varying power source are studied. These challenges are balance between production and consumption in the power system, excess of power etc. The results show that increasing the wind power production results in a decrease in CO emissions. This can be seen from the diﬀerent simulations in the project. However, the results show that increasing the wind power production means that the system becomes more sensitive to keep the power balance. Moreover, the discharge capacity and the eﬃciency of the hydro power plants are important factors in the test system. i"
