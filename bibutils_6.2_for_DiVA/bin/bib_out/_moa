title="Trading with digital ads: A possible future scenario",
abstract="Up until now, the way advertising space online, also called inventory, is traded has been unquestioned and few attempts have been made trying to predict the future of digital advertising trading, and especially the similarities with other trading markets. One of the major outcomes of this thesis is an analysis of a possible future scenario where a futures exchange for digital advertising will develop. The purpose of the analysis has been to identify which market mechanisms and key factors that will be crucial for a secondary futures market for digital advertising in order for it to be well-functioning and create enough value. The thesis is based on three different sources of information: observations, a literature study and interviews. Firstly, observations were done to get a holistic view of the digital advertising industry and general understanding for the challenges the industry is facing. Secondly, a literature review of existing research in the field of advertising, finance, and market design has been done. Thirdly, interviews with key players in the two industries were held. The thesis has been commissioned by Schibsted Products and Technology within Schibsted Media Group. A company with their core business in digital advertising, and an advertising platform playing an essential role for their future profitable growth. The analysis in this theses has shown that, in order to attract traders, the new market needs to be thick and liquid enough, which requires key functions such as; issuers, market makers and secondary platform providers. However, the underlying asset of these contracts is based on digital advertising inventory - difficult to forecast. This will require a standardized design of the contracts, and put a great pressure on the forecasting and pricing functions of the issuers on this market. By enable trading and re-trading of standardized contracts through a futures exchange publishers will be able to retain the benefits from direct sales, and reduce the disadvantages of today's way of selling guaranteed contracts. The futures exchange would provide transparency and imply a ``fairer'' way of trading and pricing as well as create new revenue streams, building liquidity on the digital advertising market. Key-words: ``digital advertising'', ``advertising exchange'', ``programmatic'', ``real-time bidding'', ``financial exchange'', ``financial trading'', ``auctions, ``primary market'', ``spot market'', ``secondary market'', ``futures market'', ``futures'', ``derivatives'', ``clearinghouse'', ``market maker'', ``market design'', ``trading'', ``exchange'', ``market microstructure'', ``marketplace'', ``over-the-counter'', etc."
