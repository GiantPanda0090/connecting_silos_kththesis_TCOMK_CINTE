abstract="3D segmentation of tissues in the knee joint helps to visualise lesions and defor- mations, enabling computer-aided diagnosis and treatment planning of patients with knee problems. Manual segmentation is, however, time-consuming and sub- ject to inter-rater variability, creating a natural desire for methods enabling au- tomated segmentation. There is a range of segmentation methods reported with good results for tissues in the human body. Some tissues do however still remain challenging to segment, such as the relatively small structure of the menisci in the knee. The development of machine learning in recent years has dramatically improved automated image segmentation and classiﬁcation tasks[1], making it a natural choice for the more challenging menisci segmentation. In this thesis, two fully automated machine learning segmentation methods are implemented and compared for segmentation of the menisci, namely Random Forest based on Haar-like features and the deep learning method 2D UNet fully convolutional network (FCN). Both methods were tested and compared for segmentation of 18 menisci from 3D magnetic resonance (MR) images. The 2D UNet cascade showed superior results compared to the Random Forest for segmentation of the menisci, with a mean Dice Similarity Coeﬃcient (DSC) of 75.3{\%} compared to 54.4{\%}. Furthermore, 2D UNet cascade was also tested on additional 28 subjects for single- and multi-class segmentation of distal femur and articular cartilage from 3D MR images. The single-class 2D UNet cascade gave marginally better results compared to the multi-class segmentation with a mean DSC of 95.3{\%} for distal femur and 71.7{\%} for the articular cartilage. With limited training data, the proposed 2D UNet cascade segmentation method shows promising results for all three tissues. Based on the results pre- sented in this thesis, future work is proposed to focus on the 2D UNet cascade algorithm. Further training on more data as well as dividing images for training in separate networks based on properties of the images is suggested."
