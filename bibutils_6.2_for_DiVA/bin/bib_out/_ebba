title="Sustainability Practices on University Campuses: Case Study of Zhejiang University and KTH Royal Institute of Technology: A case study on opinions and pedagogics regarding hydrogen fuel cells in Sandviken",
abstract="This report provides an analysis of the energy consumption and a study of the sustainability work regarding buildings at Zhejiang University, ZJU, and the Royal Institute of Technology, KTH. Three students from KTH performed a field study at ZJU in Hangzhou, China, in the year of 2017. By interviewing actors at KTH and ZJU and studying the differences in conditions, policies and regulations the results shows how the sustainability work regarding buildings differentiates between the universities. The result of the study shows that both universities have national goals, policies and regulations they have to follow that give different incentives to encourage sustainable development. KTH and Sweden also needs to consider laws and policies of the European Union, EU. KTH and Akademiska Hus, AH, have sustainability goals of their own while ZJU only have provincial goals in addition to the national. If ZJU wants to be a leading university in the field of sustainable development, the authors suggest that they make sustainability goals of their own. AH is the property owner at KTH campus and they decide what kind of energy sources to use in their buildings. They cooperate with KTH to establish the sustainability work while ZJU owns all their buildings, which makes them in charge of the sustainability work themselves. To evaluate properties in terms of sustainability, KTH uses Milj{\"o}byggnad certification and ZJU is using the Three Star System. The authors have concluded that the difference in prerequisites between the two countries makes it difficult for ZJU to use the same amount of renewable energy in their buildings as KTH. If ZJU would like to use only renewables they need to produce it themselves. ZJU monitors 150 of their 500 buildings, while AH monitors all buildings at KTH. The authors recommend that ZJU put sensors in all their buildings to monitor the energy consumption in order to get a fair image of the situation in terms of energy use."
