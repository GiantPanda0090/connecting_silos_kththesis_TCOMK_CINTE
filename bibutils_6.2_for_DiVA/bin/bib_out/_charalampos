title="Low slope roofs: Moisture transfer in inverted roofs constantly exposed to high moisture loads and drainage systems",
abstract="Low slope roofs are roofs with an inclination between 1:16 and 1:4 and have been constructed and preferred for many years due to the benefits they present. The goal of the present work is to study the following problems of low slope roofs, as they are suggested by previous relevant theses and the current needs of the market. 1. Moisture transfer in low slope roofs with constant exposure to high levels of relative humidity. Is protection against corrosion required for steel beams placed directly under the external membranes? If yes, what kind of protection is that? 2. Roof drainage on low slope roofs The study of the first subject was based on simulations of this type of structures in order to see how external moisture affects the moisture level and the potential for corrosion on steel beams. The main goal was to conclude whether we can actually build inverted roofs with steel plates or beams lying right under the roof membrane and what kind of protection is more appropriate to apply, in case it is required. According to the literature review conducted on roof structures, corrosion and corrosion protection, as well as the results of the simulations, the main factor defining the corrosion potential is the indoor environment. Moreover, paint coating seems to be the indicated anticorrosive protection. Regarding drainage, the study focused on the literature review of the current situation, the solutions applied, the existing regulations and guidelines regarding the type of systems used (full flow or gravity, internal or external), the construction of drainage valleys (inclined or horizontal) and the placement and dimensioning of drains and overflows, in order to create a short handbook with issues to be considered by the roof engineer. The main conclusions are that drain valleys are suggested to be constructed completely horizontal, in order to facilitate the cooperation between drains, and that full-flow systems are more efficient than gravity ones and should be preferred, as long as the roof is not exposed to solid material and prone to its accumulation around drains (e.g. roofs covered with vegetation or stone ballast, with overhanging or nearby trees). Key words: inverted roof, roof membrane, corrosion, atmospheric corrosion, corrosion protection, paint coatings, drainage, horizontal valleys, drains, overflows II"
