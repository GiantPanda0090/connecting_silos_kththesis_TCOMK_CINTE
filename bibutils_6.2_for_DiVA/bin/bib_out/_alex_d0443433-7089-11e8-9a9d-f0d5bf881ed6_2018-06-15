abstract="In today's market, the largest part of the housing supply originates from the private sector. With political visions of an increased production of residential units and a large number of private companies active in the market since a long time, the competition for building rights has hardened and the opportunities for acquiring attractive land parcels have become smaller. This degree project aims at describing, investigating and analyzing the most common strategies for private developers in the acquisition of residential building rights. This involves a closer examination of various developer's views on the process of land acquisitions, the reason behind the choice of strategy and what criteria that are generally set for the execution of acquisitions. In order to achieve this, representatives from seven property development companies have been interviewed, all of whom have been responsible for the identification, analysis and purchase of building rights on behalf of the respective companies. The main purpose of the qualitative interview study has been to examine developer's views on different acquisition strategies and to investigate which criteria that must be fulfilled to implement either one or the other strategy. Overall, four different acquisition strategies have been identified and analyzed: (i) conditional acquisitions, (ii) acquisition of completed building rights, (iii) acquisition of raw land, and (iv) acquisition of investment properties. The results from the study show that risk level, economic profitability and the ability to influence the design of a project are the most prioritized factors in the choice of acquisition strategy. Furthermore, the result also shows that proximity to communications and service facilities plays a central role in the selection of development areas. Out of all strategies, it has been found that the so-called conditional acquisitions are the most prevalent. This acquisition strategy means that legal possession and payment of the land are subject to receipt of a satisfactory planning permission and that the developer by operating this strategy minimizes its planning risk and tied up capital. Furthermore, it appears that the municipalities' visions in combination with the potential of the land as a future residential area constitute the most central parameters for the acquisition of raw land. The main advantage of these type of acquisitions is the developer's ability to absorb the refinement gain arising from the change in land use and through the creation of new residential building rights. Regarding the acquisition of zoned land, the study shows that competition in this asset class is pronounced and that the most vital factors in an investment decision are the price of the building rights and the design of the zoning plan. The advantage of this strategy is that the developer eliminates the planning risk and enables a shorter development process. Regarding the acquisition of investment properties, this strategy is considered to be an effective complement to the other strategies and has its main advantage in the revenue streams generated during the planning process and the more beneficial capital structure created by the borrowing potential that a property's existing cash flow allows."
