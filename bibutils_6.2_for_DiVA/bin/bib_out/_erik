title="V{\"a}rmelaster i laboratorium: Unders{\"o}kning av laboratorieutrustnings v{\"a}rmeavgivning",
abstract="Buildings with laboratories often have more equipment and thus they are greater consumers of energy than conventional office buildings. With a large amount of equipment and with equipment that also can have a high-power consumption it comes large heating loads to the room that needs to be cooled and this cooling requirements must be established during the design phase of a building project. One of the challenges designing the cooling system of a building is to make an estimate of how large the internal heat loads are from the electronic equipment in the room. When the tenants' choice of equipment is not known, the designer uses a standard or experience value as an estimate of the internal heat loads and to which extent the equipment will be used. This estimate of the internal heat loads has in many cases shown to be wrongly estimated for all types of building but when it comes to laboratories the challenge is even greater since there are few construction projects that involves laboratories which means that there is less experience and knowledge to make a well-based judgement of the heat loads. This results in laboratories that in many cases has a cooling system which is oversized leading to excessive investment costs, inefficient installations and higher operating costs. The aim of this thesis has been to provide a better basis for design processes of laboratories in the future by examining how well the manufacturers' information on nameplate power is consistent with the real consumption. The thesis has also tried to show how often and to what extent the equipment is being used. This is achieved by assuming that all of the equipment's plug load is converted into heat and supplied to the room. Through this assumption, the equipment's heat load has been determined by measuring and logging the plug load over a week's time. This work made measurements on eight types of equipment and the result of the measurements shows that the user diversity for all the measured equipment were 43{\%}. Dividing the equipment in nameplate power above and below 1000 W the user diversity is 4{\%} for the first and 53{\%} for the latter. The ice maker and the shaking incubator made up 65{\%} of the total consumption during the measurement period, and they were by far the highest consumer. Looking at the equipment that has an intermittent use pattern, it was the biosafety cabinets and the shaking incubator who had the most time in active mode. Compared with data available for laboratory equipment on Labs21 Wiki webpage equipment with a rated power of 1000 W had an average in user diversity which was 50{\%} and equipment with a rated power below 1000 W had an average of 74{\%} in user diversity. As the findings of this work shows there is great opportunities to improve and make more precise design of a laboratory's heat loads. With a more precise estimation of the heat loads new challenges will be faced and the risk that a system instead becomes undersized will be higher and the possibilities to change a laboratory's equipment in the future will be lower. The benefits of a more precise cooling systems are many where there are large savings potential both economically and environmentally."
