title="Reseavdrag: - En analys av ett arbetsmarknadspolitiskt styrmedel ur ett h{\aa}llbarhetsperspektiv",
abstract="The ability to make tax deductions on travel expenses have been present in Sweden since the late 1920s. The main purpose of the state subsidy has been to improve the mobility in the label market. However, in recent years there has been a heated debate as to if the subsidy is truly socio-economically sustainable or not. The favoritism of car users has also made the matter a question of ecological sustainability. The aim of this essay is to analyse and provide general knowledge of the swedish system of deductible travel expenses. The text is divided into four major parts: ● A litterature review presenting the history of the subsidy, previous research, and the current political debate. ● A questionnaire survey where the general public's opinion of tax-deductible travel expenses is examined. ● A discussion of possible adjustments of the different parameters of the system, where the most optimal ammendment is chosen ● An analysis of 3 different scenarios; keeping the current system, using the ammended system obtained in the calibration, and removing the system. From the results we could conclude that an ammended system would be noticeably more socio-economically viable and ecologically sustainable, compared with the current system. However, a complete removal of the system would be the most optimal. In addition, the questionnaire surveys results shows that the public is mostly positive to travel deductions. However, it was apparent that the views of many could shift completely, when presenting facts. Kandidatexamensarbete AL125X Anna Strand, Jonatan Abraham VT-17 3 Inneh{\aa}llsf{\"o}rteckning"
