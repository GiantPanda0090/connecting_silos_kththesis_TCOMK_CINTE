title="Applying Knowledge Management to Projects in the Financial Sector: A case study of knowledge management in projects at a Swedish bank",
abstract="Within the financial sector, a Swedish bank realized that there was a need for knowledge management improvements in its projects, as new financial regulations forced the bank to conduct a large number of projects at once. Through these projects, it became apparent that knowledge management faltered within the organization. Knowledge management is a subject that has been rising in popularity since the end of the 20 th century. Knowledge management theories focus on allowing organizations to utilize the knowledge that resides within its employees and has proven to create significant advantages for organizations. Furthermore, knowledge management theories can be utilized to improve efficiency of projects. The purpose of this exploratory case study is to apply knowledge management theories to projects in a bank to identify challenges for knowledge management for its projects, as well as identifying potential improvements for these challenges. This is done primarily through a series of interviews at the studied bank. This thesis shows that several challenges can arise for projects within the financial sector. These challenges can be divided into three focus areas: challenges for understanding knowledge, challenges for knowledge management processes and challenges for institutionalization. Moreover, two to three key challenge topics are found within each focus area. Nevertheless, by applying current knowledge management theories improvements for these challenges areas can be found. Throughout this thesis, it has been shown that knowledge management can lead to an increase in organizational knowledge, which in turn can enhance the individual's knowledge, resulting in a positive spiral of knowledge creation and utilization. Moreover, improving knowledge management in projects can reduce double work over projects while allowing projects to better keep track of their knowledge, resulting in a higher project efficiency. To conclude the thesis, to improve knowledge management for projects in the financial sector, focus should be on three main focus areas. By improving these areas, knowledge can be better managed in projects, allowing projects to progress more efficiently, which in turn results in a higher competitive advantage for the organization. Key-words: Knowledge management, project, financial sector, bank, institutionalization, knowledge processes, temporary organization."
