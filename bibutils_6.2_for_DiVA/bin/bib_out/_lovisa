abstract="The physical environment of a place makes it easier or more difficult to commit crimes; it can also make the place feel safe or unsafe. This means that crime and unsafety can be prevented through architecture and urban planning. In order to do this knowledge is essential, knowledge of which problems exist, where these problems occur, and of how crimes and unsafety can be prevented through changes in the physical environment. This report will contribute that knowledge. In this report, the physical environment of Skiftingehus' schoolyard is studied. Skiftingehus is located in the city of Eskilstuna, Sweden. With an upcoming renovation and rebuilding of the school, there is an opportunity to design the physical environment so that crimes and unsafety are reduced. The aim of this report is to gain a deeper understanding of how crimes and unsafety can be prevented through planning or changes in the physical environment. The aim is achieved through a literature overview, an analysis of a survey and a visit to Skiftingehus' schoolyard. Answers to the following questions were sought: What problems with crime and unsafety are found at the schoolyard, where do these problems occur, and how can the physical environment be improved to prevent crime and unsafety? Crime Prevention Through Environmental Design is a theory based on six principles of how the physical environment should be designed to prevent crime. These principles have been used to formulate suggestions on how to improve the physical environment of Skiftingehus' schoolyard. A dark pedestrian tunnel through the school building is regarded as unsafe. This report does not provide a clear answer as to how the problem with the tunnel should be solved. One suggestion is to close the tunnel in order to prevent crime and unsafety, another suggestion is to improve its image through, for example, colour and make surveillance easier through better lighting. 4"
