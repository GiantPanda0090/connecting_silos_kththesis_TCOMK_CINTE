title="Improving the location of existing recycling stations using GIS: Powered by TCPDF (www.tcpdf.org)",
abstract="The European Parliament and Council's directive highlights the importance that each country recycles by placing high demands on European countries' recycling of produced material. Accordingly, Swedish law puts pressure on the individual to recycle all of his/hers packaging. In order to enable and encourage individuals to recycle, thus ensuring the objectives of the directive, it is necessary that the public has a high accessibility to recycling stations. Hence, an optimized location of the stations are desired. This essay aims to improve the location of the existing recycling stations in Bromma. This was done by analyzing and evaluating the current recycling stations using Geographic Information Systems (GIS). The analyses were based on the population data from Statistiska centralbyr{\aa}n and the preferred walking distance to a recycling station was derived from literature. Close proximity to supermarkets as well as public transportation was also taken into consideration in the evaluation. In order to determine the optimal location, the recycling stations were relocated in three respects; distributed so their service areas do not overlap, close to supermarkets and close to public transport. The three new locations were evaluated like the original locations to determine if an improvement had occurred. According to the results, the existing recycling stations provide their service with the preferred walking distance of 640 meters to 51 {\%} of Bromma's population. The three different relocations resulted in a population increase for each set of service areas, of which recycling stations where their service areas did not overlap accounted for the largest increase. However, whether that location method yields the optimal location is not obvious and further studies in that area with complementary methods is proposed."
