title="Ganymede's hydrogen corona and FUV albedo from HST/STIS images: En j{\"a}mf{\"o}relsestudie kring k{\"o}n och syssels{\"a}ttning",
abstract="Ganymede, the largest moon in our Solar System, has been a target for intensive scientiﬁc research during the past decades. Since 1998, the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS) onboard of the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) has observed it in ﬁve diﬀerent HST campaigns, operating in a wavelength range between 1150-1730 {\AA}. The images were obtained when Ganymede was located at diﬀerent orbital phase, providing information about both the trailing and leading hemispheres, and allowing for the search of potential hemispherical and time variability. Here, we analyze Ganymede's HST/STIS observations in the search for a hydrogen exosphere and the study of the far-ultraviolet (FUV) albedo at diﬀerent wavelengths. The hydrogen corona is expected to scatter sunlight at the Lyman-$\alpha$ wavelength (1216 {\AA}), which is within STIS' spectral range. We analyze the observations at this particular wavelength, and derive models for the diﬀerent sources of emission that are expected to contribute to the signal. We also estimate the potential extinction of Ganymede's coronal emissions in the Earth's upper atmosphere, which can be up to 85{\%}. The comparison between the HST/STIS images and the model allows us to detect the hydrogen exosphere, which we estimate to be in a range of approximately (2-8) {\texttimes} 10 cm . The atomic hydrogen abundance in Ganymede's atmosphere during HST campaign 13328 appears to be signiﬁcantly lower, which could be related to diﬀerences in the plasma magnetospheric environment. We study Ganymede's FUV albedo comparing the reﬂectance at diﬀerent wavelengths, and potential diﬀerence between leading and trailing hemispheres. We ﬁnd out that the trailing hemisphere is brighter than the leading side for $\lambda$ < 1600 {\AA}. This dichotomy is opposite to the previous results reported for $\lambda$ > 2000 {\AA}, where the leading hemisphere is actually brighter. Hence, there is a spectral inversion of Ganymede's surface reﬂectivity at some wavelength in the range 1600-2000 {\AA}. We also ﬁnd out that the reﬂectivity of the surface increases for $\lambda$ < 1400 {\AA}, which might be related to space weathering processes on the surface. III"
