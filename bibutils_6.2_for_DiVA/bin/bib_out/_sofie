title="Automation of manual Hepatitis E (HEV) and Hepatitis A (HAV) PCR analysis to Tecan FreedomEVO 1: Backcasting the SDGs",
abstract="Automation of the hepatitis E virus (HEV) PCR analysis at Octapharma AB has been developed as a part of this degree project from KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm. The manual pipetting procedures utilized in the HEV PCR analysis of human blood plasma have been automated in the Tecan Freedom EVO 150 laboratory robot and the resulting programs could also be applied for TaqMan based detection of hepatitis A virus (HAV). Four scripts corresponding to different stages of the manual HEV pipetting procedure were programmed in the EVOware software. The programs were first developed with water as sample matrix and were thereafter adapted to the more viscous plasma matrix and were finally tested with PCR amplification of virus containing plasma samples of varying concentrations. The results from the automated experiments were compared to results from equivalently performed manual experiments. Finally, the automated and manual HEV pipetting procedures were statistically evaluated in a Probit analysis of HAV samples in the statistical computer program CombiStat. The method sensitivity for the automated procedure calculated in the Probit analysis was determined to 2.23 IU/mL and the method sensitivity for the manual pipetting procedure was determined to 3.61 IU/mL. The results from the comparative manual and automated experiments revealed no significant differences in viral detection of positive samples nor in fluorescence levels or crossing point values in the amplification. The automated approach was therefore assessed to have no negative impact on the analysis and based on the improved method sensitivity and the equivalence of the automated and manual amplification parameters, the automated the HEV- and HAV PCR analyses were judged as viable and comparable replacements of the established manual pipetting procedures. 2 (93)"
