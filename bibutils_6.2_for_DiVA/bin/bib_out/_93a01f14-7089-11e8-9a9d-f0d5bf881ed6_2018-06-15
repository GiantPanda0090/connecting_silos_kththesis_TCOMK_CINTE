abstract="How the layout and design of a workplace affects the productivity and profitability of an organisation is a well-researched phenomenon. There is an on-going trend among knowledge-heavy organisations to implement activity-based workplaces, were the employees lack fixed and assigned workstations. However, few empirical studies examining the consequences of activity-based working exist, and the result from the few that do exist are often contradictory. Wohlers and Hertel (2016) proposes a theoretical model for activity-based working. Using the term moderators, Wohler and Hertel attempts to explain the relationship between activity-based office features, conditions and outcomes. Based on Wohlers and Hertel's model, the purpose of this study is to investigate and describe the factors behind activity-based working and its outcomes. This study was conducted as a case study at a Swedish service company. Through a total of eleven interviews and one survey, empirical data was gathered that provided supporting evidence for some of the moderators and contradictory indications for others. For instance, task variety and special office design features would indeed seem to affect the suitability of the concept and implementation directly. Meanwhile, we could not find any indications that older employees perceive the concept as more positive than young employees do. Instead, the younger employees reported higher levels of well-being and comfort, which could be traced back to a greater inclination to change workstation. This thesis also expands on Wohlers and Hertel's model, suggesting that additional moderators and aspects, such as onsite leadership and the change process, are of great importance. Based on these insights, theoretical and practical implications as well as future research directions are discussed."
