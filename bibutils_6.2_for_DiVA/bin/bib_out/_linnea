title="Co-creation as a Market Entry Strategy: Key areas to consider when entering a market by co-creating digital HR-tools",
abstract="Co-creation is an increasingly common product development strategy to create customized tools. It is based on collaboration and joint production of value between a supplier and customer. Co- creation may be a favorable strategy for early stage companies to gain customers and enter the market. While there are a variety of market entry strategies, this study is based on the insufficient attention among these to the customer as a possible collaborator when entering. This lack of attention is noteworthy since theory shows that the customer is gaining increased power over a supplier's business decisions, largely due to digitalization. There is a need to introduce a strategy that defines how companies co-create with their customers and regards them as an allied. This close relationship provides mutual benefits, sustainable relationships and networks. Consequently, this study aims to investigate if a co-creation strategy can be used to enter a market for an early stage company. The study is based on inductive reasoning and qualitative research methods. It uses semi- structured interviews, active participating observations and a literature study to collect primary and secondary data. The study proposes that co-creation is a new type of market entry strategy and suggests three key areas to consider for an early stage company when entering. These areas are: development approach, ownership and product protection, and expectation and communication.
