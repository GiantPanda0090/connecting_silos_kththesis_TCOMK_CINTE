title="Hydrogen fuel cells for the development of a sustainable society: A case study on opinions and pedagogics regarding hydrogen fuel cells in Sandviken",
abstract="Last couple of years' vehicles propelled by electricity generated from a hydrogen fuel cell has emerged as an alternative to the fossil fuel vehicles, so that the greenhouse gas emissions causing climate change can decrease. In Sandviken, a collaboration between the municipality, Sandvik AB and AGA has resulted in a hydrogen refuelling station, only the fourth in Sweden. As the knowledge and awareness of hydrogen fuel cells is unknown Sandvik AB wants to investigate what the general opinion and knowledge is but more importantly, how can pedagogical theories be used to increase awareness and knowledge. The purpose of this thesis is therefore to examine what the population of Sandviken think of a development of a hydrogen society as well as climate change and the concept of sustainable development. Based on the found status of knowledge and awareness in these issues a couple of tools and actions are suggested on how to increase general knowledge and awareness, applicable both for schools and organisations outside school. The method used to fulfil the purpose was a survey that was sent out to people employed at Sandviken municipality and Sandvik AB. The survey results were analysed to see which factors correlate with a likelihood to support a hydrogen society development. That is used to see what approach to use when educating people about hydrogen and sustainable development. The results show that people in Sandviken were very positive about the hydrogen refuelling station, and the level of knowledge people had did not significantly affect how much support they showed. However, the people's support for a hydrogen development is greatly affected by the fact that a refuelling station has been built. Therefore, the result that the level of hydrogen knowledge seems irrelevant should not be taken as a general fact true for all societies. When educating people about hydrogen one should put emphasis on raising awareness and knowledge in sustainable development and climate change, since that has a positive effect on the likelihood to support a hydrogen development. This could be done via a, in this report constructed, SSI case (socio-scientific issues) that can be adjusted to fit environments and occasions outside school."
