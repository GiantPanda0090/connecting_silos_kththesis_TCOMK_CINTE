title="Architecture Design and Interoperability Analysis of a SCADA System for the Power Network Control and Management: the Potential of Renewable Energy",
abstract="SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition) systems have been widely used during the last decades delivering excellent results for the power network operation and management. However, some current customer requirements are for SCADA systems to integrate external components in order to perform advanced power network studies and develop both existing and new business processes. This novel viewpoint will make these systems evolve from a monolithic infrastructure towards a loosely coupled and flexible architecture. Hence, new needs have arisen with the aim of improving the system interoperability, reducing the complexity and enhancing the maintainability. This master{\textasciiacute}s thesis project presents an Interoperability Prediction Framework (IPF), that supports the architecture design process during the early stages of product development. In addition, this work has also investigated some alternative architectures, which have been modelled and verified using the previously mentioned framework. A first conceptual architecture has been designed to improve the internal system interoperability, reducing the coupling between the basic SCADA and the Energy Management System (EMS). Later, a second architecture that allows the integration of external components has been introduced to promote the external interoperability. Results show that the proposed architectures are correct (according to the IPF) and the interoperability of the system is improved. Furthermore, initial conclusions suggest that the final proposed solution would be less complex than the current architecture in the long term, although a large effort and substantial changes would be needed to upgrade the system architecture."
