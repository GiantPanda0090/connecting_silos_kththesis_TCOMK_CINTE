abstract="The number of cyclists is Sweden has been on the uprise in recent years [1] and with more bikes in traﬃc the risk of accidents increase. The purpose of this report is to calculate possible common denominator for these accidents with statistics from previous years' damage records and to propose actions and changes that could be made to prevent the damage. Based on the damage and accident register STRADA provided by the Traﬃc Administration, 9131 traﬃc accidents from 2015 involving one or more cyclists are analyzed to analyse patterns and connections between the accidents and circumstances. The report also deals with a possible solution to an ABS brake for bicycles, since other vehicles have had this feture as default while the bike has not received the same upgrade. From the injury statistics and other articles it is clear that there are major problems for bicycles in today's traﬃc situation beside what brake system it is equipped with. It is primary single accidents due to skid on slippery surfaces such as gravel, ice and snow which accounts for half of all accident reports. It may therefore be important to revise changing the tires for diﬀerent seasons of the year. Damage caused by other vehicles is also a large part of the statistics. It is clear that a large part of these accidents was caused solely because the motorist did not see the cyclist in time. Based on this there may be reason to review how cyclists behave in traﬃc and if there may be a correlation between accidents caused by other vehicles and cyclists who do not comply with the traﬃc rules. The solution to an ABS brake must be mechanical to keep the price and size to a minimum. The solution is therefore placed in the rear hub of the bicycle and works by compression and expansion of a rubber package during severe braking. In addition to the brake, the attitude towards the bike as a means of transport or training equipment must be transformed and instead handled and viewed as a vehicle. Through increased awareness by the cyclists in traﬃc as well as inspection, maintenance and adaptation to the seasons there is a potential to reduce the accident rate signiﬁcantly."
