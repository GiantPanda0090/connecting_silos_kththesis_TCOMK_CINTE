title="Erfarande av museiutst{\"a}llningar med hj{\"a}lp av virtuell verklighet: A study of how sensors can be combined to withstand build-up materials and improve reliability in harsh environment",
abstract="This master thesis investigates the museum exhibition Royal Wedding Dresses at the Stockholm castle. This exhibition was temporary and closed in April 2017. The overall purpose is to map what can be done in order to raise interest and create meaning in a broader audience including younger people to take part in the exhibition, and create meaning of it after it has been closed down. An additional purpose is to investigate how, why, and whom the museum exhibition Royal Wedding Dresses can interest using virtual reality (VR), after the end of the exhibition. In this survey, a literature study, interviews and observations are performed regarding the exhibition Royal Wedding Dresses. This is the basis for developing a VR application prototype where major parts of the exhibition are included. Finally, the application is evaluated for technical interaction and how the virtual visit has been evaluated, to assess whether VR can create interest in, and develop, the exhibition for a wider audience. The result indicates that the application has good technical interaction, but the original exhibition does not encourage the visitor to experience it, and the application is unable to develop it in this regard. The application will not be more interesting for a younger audience than its content. With the help of aspects of serious gaming and social interaction, as well as future studies on the subject with more respondents and an expanded perspective, it may be possible to overcome these limitations. If technical interaction and social interaction can be integrated, the experience can also be developed and be put in a meaningful context that encourages experience and better retention of the virtual visit."
