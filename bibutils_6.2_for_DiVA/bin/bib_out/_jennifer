abstract="Cellulose nanoﬁbrils (CNF) is a renewable material with unique strength prop- erties. A diﬃculty in CNF production is that CNF suspensions contain large amounts of water. If CNF suspension volume can be decreased by dewatering facilitated by centrifugation, then transportation costs and storage costs can be reduced. The aim of this thesis is to investigate the impact various parameters have on CNF centrifugation dewatering and identify optimal conditions for max- imal water removal. A laboratory study was conducted using four materials; 2.0 w{\%} enzymatically treated CNF (CNF1), 1.9 w{\%} carboxymethylated CNF (CNF2) and two commer- cial samples ( 1.9 w{\%} CNFA and 1.8 w{\%} CNFB). The main method was analytical centrifugation up to 2330 g. Parameters tested were initial concentration before centrifugation, temperature, NaCl addition, pH, and applied solid compressive pressure (g-force and surface weight). In addition to centrifugation experiments the four materials were characterized with laser diﬀraction, UV-vis absorption, Dynamic light scattering, and dry weight measurements. Analysis of the experimental data collected show that increase in initial con- centration give a higher ﬁnal concentration, but less water is removed. Further- more, temperature changes have no eﬀect on separation of CNF and water. At an applied solid compressive pressure of 3 kPa and initial concentration at 1.5 w{\%} the concentrations 5.5 w{\%}, 1.5 w{\%}, 4.0 w{\%}, and 4.3 w{\%} can be reach for CNF1, CNF2, CNFA, and CNFB respectively. After extrapolation of polynomial functions ﬁtted to experimental data an applied solid compressive pressure of 22 kPa and initial concentration at 1.5 w{\%}, the concentrations 9.1 w{\%}, 1.5 w{\%}, 6.9 w{\%}, and 7.9 w{\%} are predicted for CNF1, CNF2, CNFA, and CNFB respectively. The thickening of CNF suspensions achieved and predicted in this thesis implies possibilities for large amounts of water removal, e.g. the water content in a CNF1 suspension is reduced from 65.7 litres/kg CNF to 10.0 litres/kg CNF at the solid compressive pressure 22 kPa. The concentrations at 22 kPa are determined by extrapolation from experimental data <3 kPa solid compressive pressure. The carboxymethylated CNF2 can not be dewatered unless it is diluted or if salt or pH is adjusted. This is directly correlated to the electrostatic forces in the sus- pension and the Debye length. Addition of salt or lowered pH also eliminate any concentration gradients in diluted and centrifuged CNF2 suspensions."
