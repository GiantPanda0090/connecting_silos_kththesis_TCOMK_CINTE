abstract="In two of the mobile applications developed by Bontouch there exists an AR view which eased the discovery of cer- tain points of interest. In the application developed for the Swedish postal service, PostNord, there exists such an AR view to help the users ﬁnd delivery points of parcels handled by PostNord. The AR view does not perform as desired when the user is close to a delivery point due to in- consistent or faulty sensor data received from the rotation sensors and the GPS. This thesis is focused on how to make the AR view more stable in these instances. To accomplish this stabilization the approach tested is where the video feed captured by the camera of the phone is analyzed to ﬁnd the logotype of Posten and ﬁxating the unstable point of interest to this logotype. Two diﬀerent detectors are evaluated and tested for the best result. One of the approaches implements the ORB algorithm and ﬁnds the logotype in the image. The second one utilized the knowledge of the logotype to make clever assumptions of which the contours in the image will need to satisfy, then the candidates will be evaluated by the colors inside the contour. Once a match has been found it will then be analysed to determine if it was a true match of the logotype. If the match was a true positive the delivery point in the AR view will be ﬁxated on this logotype. Three diﬀerent approaches on how to perform this will be discussed and evaluated."
