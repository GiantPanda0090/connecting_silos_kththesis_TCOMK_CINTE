abstract="Traditional and well established project delivery methods have during an extended time been used in the construction sector. During the last decades, usage of alternative process methods and organizational structures has increased within the Swedish construction sector. Thus, the process of choosing a project delivery method is getting more complex. Clients are benefitted from having good knowledge about different ways of operating construction projects. Clients' aim for construction projects with low level of risk, at the same time the project should be efficient in terms of costs, time and quality. The outcome of a project is highly dependent on decisions being taken early in the process, though the possibility of risk-minimization and changes decreases over time. Therefore, one of the most important decisions for clients is the choice of project delivery method. Construction Management (CM) is one of the alternative project delivery methods that have increased in usage within the Swedish construction and real estate market. Consequently, clients have one additional project delivery method to evaluate in aspects of what risks and possibilities it would entail to the project. This study evaluates what risks and possibilities CM-projects have in relation to other methods and identifies when the project delivery method is most suitable to use. Further, the study examines the level of knowledge concerning CM among different actors within the Swedish construction sector. The purpose of this study is to increase the knowledge of the project delivery method and to suggest possible changes in the way CM is used. The study comprises a qualitative interview based method where a wide spread of actors from the Swedish construction and real estate market are participating. The result is founded upon the perceptions, experiences and reflections the participating actors have expressed. The result of this study shows that CM can be used in all types of projects, where the benefits of the delivery method are best used in complex projects with high levels of risk and uncertainty. The use of CM could lead to shorter project time, lower price and give the client possibilities of cost effective changes. However, the project risk and responsibility is to a greater extent held by the client. The respondents expressed a difference about the contractual risk levels and the levels based upon experience from project results, which makes it hard to evaluate if CM relates to a higher or lower degree of risk in comparison to the traditional delivery methods. A lot of possible changes could be implemented in the way CM-projects are executed to adapt more to the clients' needs and thereby increase the demand of the project delivery method. These changes contain modified contracts between consultants and clients to move parts of the risk to the CM-organization that holds the project management. Further changes in how the consultant fees are charged and how the warranties are handled could decrease the clients{\textasciiacute} concerns with CM-projects."
