It is an important question as the market demand is changing rapidly and puts high pressure on companies to constantly deliver new innovations. The study is based on panel data and ordinary least squares regressions. The findings are similar to previous studies, which points towards both positive and negative directions when referring to M{\&}A activity and its impact on R{\&}D intensity. This thesis show lack of statistical significant results when it comes to how R{\&}D intensity (R{\&}D intensity is defined as the ratio of R{\&}D expenditure to total sales) is affected by M{\&}A activity.
