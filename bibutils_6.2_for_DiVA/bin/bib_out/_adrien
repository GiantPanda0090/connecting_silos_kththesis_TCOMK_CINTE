title="Segmentation of high frequency 3D ultrasound images for skin disease characterization.: An investigation using Convolutional Neural Networks",
abstract="This work is rooted in a need for dermatologists to explore skin characteristics in depth. The inﬂuence of skin disease such as acne in dermal tissues is still a complex task to assess. Among the possibilities, high frequency ultrasound imaging is a paradigm shift to probe and characterizes upper and deep dermis. For this purpose, a cohort of 58 high-frequency 3D images has been acquired by the French laboratory Pierre Fabre in order to study acne vulgaris disease. This common skin disorder is a societal challenge and burden aﬀecting late ado- lescents across the world. The medical protocol developed by Pierre Fabre was to screen a lesion every day during 9 days for diﬀerent patients with ultrasound imaging. The provided data features skin epidermis and dermis structure with a fantastic resolution. The strategy we led to study these data can be explained in three steps. First, epidermis surface is detected among artifacts and noise thanks to a robust level-set algorithm. Secondly, acne spots are located on the resulting height map and associated to each other among the data by comput- ing and thresholding a local variance. And eventually potential inﬂammatory dermal cavities related to each lesion are geometrically and statistically char- acterized in order to assess the evolution of the disease. The results present an automatic algorithm which permits dermatologists to screen acne vulgaris lesions and to characterize them in a complete data set. It can hence be a pow- erful toolbox to assess the eﬃciency of a treatment. keywords : level-set segmentation, active contours, optimization, statistical modeling, Blitz++."
