title="Offline Sensor Fusion for Multitarget Tracking using Radar and Camera Detections: A study of how sensors can be combined to withstand build-up materials and improve reliability in harsh environment",
abstract="Autonomous driving systems are rapidly improving and may have the ability to change society in the coming decade. One important part of these systems is the interpretation of sensor information into trajectories of objects. In this master's thesis, we study an energy minimisation method with radar and camera measurements as inputs. An energy is associated with the trajectories; this takes the measurements, the objects' dynamics and more factors into consideration. The trajectories are chosen to minimise this energy, using a gradient descent method. The lower the energy, the better the trajectories are expected to match the real world. The processing is performed ofﬂine, as opposed to in real time. Ofﬂine tracking can be used in the evaluation of the sensors' and the real time tracker's performance. Ofﬂine processing allows for the use of more computer power. It also gives the possibility to use data that was collected after the considered point in time. A study of the parameters of the used energy minimisation method is presented, along with variations of the initial method. The results of the method is an improvement over the individual inputs, as well as over the real time processing used in the cars currently. In the parameter study it is shown which components of the energy function are improving the results. v"
