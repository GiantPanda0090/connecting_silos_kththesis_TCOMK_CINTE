abstract="The expected increase in precipitation and temperature in Scandinavia, and especially short-time heavy precipitation, will increase the frequency of flooding. Urban areas are the most vulnerable, and specifically, the road infrastructure. The accumulation of large volumes of water and sediments on road-stream intersections gets severe consequences for the road drainage structures. The need for a tool to identify characteristics that impacts the occurrence of flooding, and to predict future event is thus essential. This study integrates the spatial and temporal soil moisture properties into the research about flood prediction methods. Soil moisture data is derived from remote sensing techniques, with focus on the soil moisture specific satellites ASCAT and SMOS. Furthermore, several physical catchments descriptors (PCDs) are used to identify catchment characteristics that are prone to flooding and an inventory of current road drainage facilities are conducted. Finally, the index of sediment connectivity (IC) by Cavalli, Trevisani, Comiti, and Marchi (2013) is implemented to assess the flow of water and sediment within the catchment. A case study of two areas in Sweden, V{\"a}stra G{\"o}taland and V{\"a}rmland, that was affected by severe flooding in August 2014 are included. The results show that the method with using soil moisture satellite data is promising for the inclusion of soil moisture data into estimations of flooding and the index of sediment connectivity. Key words: Flooding, road infrastructure, soil moisture, remote sensing, sediment connectivity"
