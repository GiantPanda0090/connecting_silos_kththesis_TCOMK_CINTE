title="Safety of Machine Learning Systems in Autonomous Driving: A Secure Yet Employee Friendly Process Proposal of IT Security Implementation in Organizations.",
abstract="Machine Learning, and in particular Deep Learning, are extremely capable tools for solving problems which are difficult, or intractable to tackle analytically. Application areas include pattern recognition, computer vision, speech and natural language processing. With the automotive industry aiming for increasing amount of automation in driving, the problems to solve become increasingly complex, which appeals to the use of supervised learning methods from Machine Learning and Deep Learning. With this approach, solutions to the problems are learned implicitly from training data, and inspecting their correctness is not possible directly. This presents concerns when the resulting systems are used to support safety-critical functions, as is the case with autonomous driving of automotive vehicles. This thesis studies the safety concerns related to learning systems within autonomous driving and applies a safety monitoring approach to a collision avoidance scenario. Experiments are performed using a simulated environment, with a deep learning system supporting perception for vehicle control, and a safety monitor for collision avoidance. The related operational situations and safety constraints are studied for an autonomous driving function, with potential faults in the learning system introduced and examined. Also, an example is considered for a measure that indicates trustworthiness of the learning system during operation. i v v"
